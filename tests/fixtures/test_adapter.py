"""Reference IsolationAdapter implementation for testing.

This module provides a complete, working IsolationAdapter implementation
that serves two purposes:

1. **Testing**: Enables pyisolate unit tests without any host application
2. **Documentation**: Shows host implementers exactly how to build an adapter

Host developers should study this implementation as the canonical example
of how to integrate pyisolate with their application.

See Also:
    - README.md: "Implementing a Host Adapter" section
    - pyisolate/interfaces.py: IsolationAdapter protocol definition
    - tests/test_adapter_contract.py: Contract tests for adapters

Example Usage::

    from tests.fixtures.test_adapter import MockHostAdapter, MockRegistry

    # Create adapter
    adapter = MockHostAdapter(root_path="/tmp/myapp")

    # Get path configuration for an extension
    config = adapter.get_path_config("/tmp/myapp/extensions/myext/__init__.py")
    # Returns: {"preferred_root": "/tmp/myapp", "additional_paths": [...]}

    # Register custom serializers
    from pyisolate._internal.serialization_registry import SerializerRegistry
    adapter.register_serializers(SerializerRegistry.get_instance())

    # Get RPC services to expose
    services = adapter.provide_rpc_services()
    # Returns: [MockRegistry]
